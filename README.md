## Known issues

* All columns listed in "Cascading LOV Parent Column(s)" should have Static ID's. 
* SQL-queries referenced to the other columns in "Cascading LOV Parent Column(s)" should 
  return all the data  if select2.is_displaying_all = 'Y'.
  Otherwise IG clears all field with "Cascading LOV Parent Column(s)" by editiong.

   select descr,
          id
   from (select 'Alexander' as descr,
         'A1' as id,
         'A' as parent_id 
         from dual)
   where instr(:FIRST_LETTER,parent_id) > 0
      or select2.is_displaying_all = 'Y'
